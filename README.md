=======

Rust wrapper around [bgfx], providing a clean, safe API for rust applications.

**Note:** This is a fork of [rhoot/bgfx-rs](https://github.com/rhoot/bgfx-rs), which is no longer maintained.
This may also end up unmaintained, but let's give it a shot anyways.

1) x86_64 or i686
2) The x86 compiler may require an opt-in individual component in some VS versions.
3) See also [bgfx's build docs](https://bkaradzic.github.io/bgfx/build.html).  `bx`, `bimg`, and `genie` dependencies can be ignored as they're handled via submodules.



Quick Start
-----------

### Debug Examples (VS Code, Windows)

1) If you haven't already, install [VS2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/) w/ Desktop C++ Tools, [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
2) Open a `cmd` prompt
    - Run `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/MaulingMonkey/bgfx-rs.git` to get the full source code, or run `git submodule update --init` if you already had a partial checkout.
    - Run `code bgfx-rs` to open VS Code in the right folder.
3) Consider installing workspace recommended extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X` to open the Extensions tab)
4) Press `F5` to `Start Debugging`
5) Press `Enter` to select the default example, `00-helloworld`, when VS Code prompts you
6) Profit!  Set breakpoints, step through code, inspect variables, etc.

### Run Examples (Command Line, Multi-Platform)

Just use the regular cargo commands:
```
cargo run --example 00-helloworld
cargo run --example 01-cubes
```

**OSX Note:** There is currently no really clean way to exit the examples in
OSX, and closing the window may in fact cause a crash. This is due to
limitations in [glutin][glutin] (specifically [#468] and [#520]). This only
effects the examples, and not the crate itself. The best way of closing them
is to simply `Ctrl-C` in the console.
