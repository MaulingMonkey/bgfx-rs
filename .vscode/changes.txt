Update bgfx/bimg/bx, adjust to new FFI bindings.

API changes:
- Added bgfx::TextureFormat
- bgfx::reset now takes a TextureFormat
- bgfx::init now takes an Init struct, or you can just call .init() on said struct.

Example changes:
- Breakpoint on panic instead of just having the thread silently die
